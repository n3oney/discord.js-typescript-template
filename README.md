# discord.js-typescript-template
A template for Discord.JS with Typescript and a command handler.

# How do I get it?
1. Run these commands:
    1. `npx degit n3oney/discord.js-typescript-template` - this will "clone" the repository to your current directory
    2. `npm install` - this will install all the required modules
2. Create a file called `.env` and put this inside of it:
```bash
TOKEN=BotsToken
```
Replace `BotsToken` with the token of your bot.
3. You're ready to go! Just run `npm run dev` for development, or `npm run build` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript and then `npm start` to start the bot in production mode.
